# Train-Management-System
In this repo, I have generated a Train Management System using C. 
Not only I enhanced my file management concepts, function within function call, but also get to know about the difference between <string.h> and <strings.h> libraries.
It was fun to choose the source and destination place get train details related to those place and then get reservation done easily and show the passengers details and save the details in reservation.txt file for further reference or passenger's use.
